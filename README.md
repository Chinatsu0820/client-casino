# client-casino

This is the first assignment(team project) in WD4 of web-dev, Tamwood.


-------------------OUTLINE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT-------------------

* Our first assignment is going to be in teams.
* We will build a Casino web app that contains one minigame per team member.
* Your web app should be a Single Page Application (SPA).

【 Assignment Requirements 】

1. Build a Single-Page Web App for a Casino
   
2. Designate one person to host the server-side files/code on GitHub,　and a separate person to host the client-side files/code on their GitHub.
   
3. Central files should be edited only by one person; For example, designate one person to be in charge of editing the index.js of the server, and another (or the same) person to be in charge of editing your index.html of the client.

4. Additionally, each team member must: 
 -Write both the server-side and client-side code for a minigame.
 -Use at least one GET method within the logic of their minigame.
 -Use at least one POST method within the logic of their minigame.
 -Use at least one PUT or PATCH method within the logic of their minigame.
 -Read from / write to at least one .json file on the server.
 -Read from / write to at least one .csv file on the server.
 -Use the correct Status Codes when sending responses to the client from the server.
Ensure that the logic of the minigame is handled on the server-side and NOT the client-side. The client-side must only handle UI interaction, and sending and receiving data to/from the server.

5. Team members can create the same type of minigame, as long as they are clearly distinct games. For example, one person might create a slots machine minigame that slides horizontally and has certain conditions and prizes, while another person also creates a slot machine minigame but which has three vertical slides with different conditions and prizes. Both are slots machines, but different.

6. Having a Login page is optional, but we probably should still have user profiles/accounts so that we can save their tickets/tokens/coins/cash (whichever casino currency you want to use) and their rewards. 

7. Give a name to our Casinos!
